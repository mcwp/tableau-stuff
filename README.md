# tableau-stuff
Examples and experiments somehow related to Tableau.

Also a random csv conversion file that was convenient to build out of bits from the example code here.

The Elven Mining data is nonsense created to illustrate a question in Tableau.  Run the python script with the -n option to get information and instructions.  Without the twbx file, the example is pretty useless, unless you are looking for trivial examples of using the python csv package.
